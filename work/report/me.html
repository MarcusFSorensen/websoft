<h1>My report page in the course DA377B</h1>

<p><img src="img/myself.jpg" width="500" alt="Me on an image"></p>

<p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself.</p>
<p>So, a presentation might be in order. I'll begin.</p>

<p>My name is Marcus Sørensen, born and raised in vallensbæk, urban Copenhagen in denmark. I attended pilehaveskolen from 1st-9th grade and went to Borupgaard Gymnasium where I graduated in 2016. I went to spent a year working and saving up money in various jobs such as 7-eleven and Ikea. During elementary school and highschool I played badminton as a hobby and still play it from time to time at hkr campus.</p>

<p>Computer has always been an interest of mine which was mainly due to video games when I was younger. I wasn't until a few years ago that my interest for programming was peaked because a friend of mine was attending the IT-university of Copenhagen and was showing off some of his new skills.</p>

<p>Beside badminton and programming I don't have many hobbies, but I do enjoy reading books or play DnD with my friends from time to time</p>
