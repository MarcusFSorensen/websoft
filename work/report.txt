I have previously been working with gitbash and github although most of my experience has been with the
VCS in intellij. Before this lecture introduction and first lab I hadn't had any experience with Markdown
Github pages.
During our software engineering 2 course one of the subgroups in our project group developed an website
and everyone had to do a lab where we learned the basics although we used JSP and no html, css or js. We
have also had labs, during the Network application course DA374C, about developing network application such
as RESTful apis on servers. During our project we also used the MQTT protocol.
I don't have much experience with web development but I have some experience with some of the protocols
that can be used in web development such as REST and MQTT. At the moment I don't have much experience with JS,
HTML or css but have seen a little bit of it. Using a texteditor such as Visual Studio Code is also new to
me as we have mainly been using Intellij or android studio when working with android development.
Recently I have done some selfstudying on AWS where the focus have been on the solution architect point of view.
So I have some experience with webservices from AWS and which features to use, such as load 
balancing, domain names, dns, caching etc.
For this course section my TIL is how to use Github page to create webpages, how index files works and how
to use Visual Studio Code.
I also refreshed my skills in gitbash as I haven't used that in a long time.
