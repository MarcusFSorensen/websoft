<h1>A report from the course XXX</h1>
</header>

<section>
<h2>S01 report</h2>
<p>I have previously been working with gitbash and github although most of my experience has been with the
    VCS in intellij. Before this lecture introduction and first lab I hadn't had any experience with Markdown
    Github pages.
    During our software engineering 2 course one of the subgroups in our project group developed an website
    and everyone had to do a lab where we learned the basics although we used JSP and no html, css or js. We
    have also had labs, during the Network application course DA374C, about developing network application such
    as RESTful apis on servers. During our project we also used the MQTT protocol.
    I don't have much experience with web development but I have some experience with some of the protocols
    that can be used in web development such as REST and MQTT. At the moment I don't have much experience with JS,
    HTML or css but have seen a little bit of it. Using a texteditor such as Visual Studio Code is also new to
    me as we have mainly been using Intellij or android studio when working with android development.
    Recently I have done some selfstudying on AWS where the focus have been on the solution architect point of view.
    So I have some experience with webservices from AWS and which features to use, such as load 
    balancing, domain names, dns, caching etc.
    For this course section my TIL is how to use Github page to create webpages, how index files works and how
    to use Visual Studio Code.
    I also refreshed my skills in gitbash as I haven't used that in a long time. </p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Prior to this course I didn't have any experience with HTML, CSS or javascript. I had heard of them of course
    but hadn't done any work using it. 
    The role of HTML is to structure the content of the website. This is done by the use of headers, sections etc inside
    the body. 
    The role of CSS is to style the website. This is things like fonts, colors and layout.
    Javascript is used to change a website from being static to dynamic. It helps to give feedback to 
    the user and makes it possible to for example use functions and operations without having to reload
    the page.
    The browser is the client that request recources from the server. This is done using the HTTP protocol using
    CRUD. This could be to create a resource using push, read a resource using get. Update a resource using put
    or delete a resource using Delete.
    In this section I learned about html, css and javascript. I didn't know much about html or css before and didn't 
    know exactly when its used and what for. Javascript I had some knowledge of but I didnt know exactly how it interacts
    with html.
</p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>I don't have any previous experience with client side Javascript or javascript in any context.
    I feel like it's a bit like java. But loosely typed since we can just use var or const here without
    needing to declare which variable it is. Such as if statements and how to write methods seems similar and 
    familiar to when you do GUIS in java or in android using either java or kotlin.  I actually believe that
    kotlin seems more similar since it is also loosely typed but without the need of ";".
    For this exercise I used w3schools.com alot to learn how to do css styling and how to properly implement
    some of the divs. Other than that I used your coding examples. for example my ducks movement is based
    on the code that you have shared in the examples which was really helpful, I aim for a 4 at the moment
    since I have some trouble with the transition on the flags. I believe my code turned out alright but I'm 
    sure there can be plenty of improvement which I might come back and do later before the final hand in. 
    My TIL for this course is how to use all the different elements when building a website. It gave me a better
    view of how to actually use css and apply it and how to interact with your html document using javascript.
