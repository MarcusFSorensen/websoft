  <p>I have previously been working with gitbash and github although most of my experience has been with the
    VCS in intellij. Before this lecture introduction and first lab I hadn't had any experience with Markdown
    Github pages.
    During our software engineering 2 course one of the subgroups in our project group developed an website
    and everyone had to do a lab where we learned the basics although we used JSP and no html, css or js. We
    have also had labs, during the Network application course DA374C, about developing network application such
    as RESTful apis on servers. During our project we also used the MQTT protocol.
    <p>
    <p>

    I don't have much experience with web development but I have some experience with some of the protocols
    that can be used in web development such as REST and MQTT. At the moment I don't have much experience with JS,
    HTML or css but have seen a little bit of it. Using a texteditor such as Visual Studio Code is also new to
    me as we have mainly been using Intellij or android studio when working with android development.
    Recently I have done some selfstudying on AWS where the focus have been on the solution architect point of view.
    So I have some experience with webservices from AWS and which features to use, such as load 
    balancing, domain names, dns, caching etc.
    For this course section my TIL is how to use Github page to create webpages, how index files works and how
    to use Visual Studio Code.
    I also refreshed my skills in gitbash as I haven't used that in a long time.</p>

<p>Prior to this course I didn't have any experience with HTML, CSS or javascript. I had heard of them of course
    but hadn't done any work using it. 
    The role of HTML is to structure the content of the website. This is done by the use of headers, sections etc inside
    the body. 
    <p>
    <p>
    The role of CSS is to style the website. This is things like fonts, colors and layout.
    Javascript is used to change a website from being static to dynamic. It helps to give feedback to 
    the user and makes it possible to for example use functions and operations without having to reload
    the page.
    <p>
    <p>
    The browser is the client that request recources from the server. This is done using the HTTP protocol using
    CRUD. This could be to create a resource using push, read a resource using get. Update a resource using put
    or delete a resource using Delete.
    In this section I learned about html, css and javascript. I didn't know much about html or css before and didn't 
    know exactly when its used and what for. Javascript I had some knowledge of but I didnt know exactly how it interacts
    with html.

<p>I don't have any previous experience with client side Javascript or javascript in any context.
    I feel like it's a bit like java. But loosely typed since we can just use var or const here without
    needing to declare which variable it is. Such as if statements and how to write methods seems similar and 
    familiar to when you do GUIS in java or in android using either java or kotlin.  I actually believe that
    kotlin seems more similar since it is also loosely typed but without the need of ";".
    <p>
    <p>
    For this exercise I used w3schools.com alot to learn how to do css styling and how to properly implement
    some of the divs. Other than that I used your coding examples. for example my ducks movement is based
    on the code that you have shared in the examples which was really helpful, I aim for a 4 at the moment
    since I have some trouble with the transition on the flags. I believe my code turned out alright but I'm 
    sure there can be plenty of improvement which I might come back and do later before the final hand in. 
    My TIL for this course is how to use all the different elements when building a website. It gave me a better
    view of how to actually use css and apply it and how to interact with your html document using javascript.

<p>I have no previous experience using node/npm and I don't believe I have experience with equal programming tools as it felt very unfamiliar.
    I felt that node and express was actually quite satisfying to work with ones I got a hang of it. it was easy to set up, and developing a rest api using express
    is fairly straight forward and is also what we are using in our project - assignment 10. Javascript on the other hand is not very pleasent to use. As I'm still new to using it
    It can be hard sometimes to figure out exactly what the error or debug is and I miss features such as arraylist and arrays where in js we use list. I am also still in the process
    of getting used to using functions instead of methods and classes. I recently got familiar with module.exports and how to use it. Even though I like it ones I understand it, it
    was a bumpy ride to get there. For this assignment I aim for a grade 4 at this moment of push. I might be coming back ones I finish rest of the assignments and improve and aim
    for a 5. I felt like the difficulty was not that high as majority of my problems came from looking up how to do something in js that I already knew how to do in java.
    and since we are just using a texteditor I do not get the same "help" when debugging as I do in intellij, and I was just a few minutes ago stuck on a problem for 20 min +
    because I had written foreach instead of forEach and kept overseeing it.
    My TIL for this course section is how to create a REST api using express or just how to use routes in general. I feel like this exercise helped me alot to understand how to
    implement the REST api that we will use in our project.

<p>At the moment I do not like PHP very much. I feel like it is a bit clunky to me compared to using js. When html and PHP is being used in the same document it can become
    A little confusing to me. But ones I got a hang of it I really liked it. I liked how I could organize my code into headers and footers and a menu and that way make building
    a new page and editing much easier To some extent PHP reminds me of java. This is mostly when it came to using prepared statement as it feels similar to java in that sense. Other than that
    it felt a bit foreign especially with the big use of $. I felt like this assignment was much harder than others. This was not because of the coding part but because I had
    alot of trouble with getting xammp setup and access to mysql. I also had a problem with accessing my mysql from the php file but found out it was because my sever was version
    8+ and was using SHa-256 authentication which php didn't support. for the coding part I took help from looking at your code examples and reused the majority of your code. Atm I 
    aimed for a 4 but will come back to improve it if I have time before friday. My TIL is how to use  PHP to do CRUD on a database and how to set up xampp properly and use mysql through xampp.

  <p>I think popularity of programming languages is good as it makes it so more people will be working in the same language. This way by knowing the popular languages it will be easier
      to adapt into a new job or a hobby project. It is also good since if a language is popular it will have a big community who will be able to help eachother and it will be 
      easier to find help. A language being popular also means that it will have more support and will update more regurlarly. I think the popularity of languages will stay almost the
      same. I do believe maybe some android developers might change and use kotlin more since you can just declare variables and you don't use ; anymore. and in general it has some different
      syntaxes. Maybe more people will start to use python in general now that machine learning is just getting bigger and bigger. I haven't tried it myself but of what I have read
      python is supposed to have very easy syntaxes and easily readible code even for beginners.
      <p>
      <p>
      After doing research on trends.google I have the same impression as before except that kotlin is being used way less that I imagined. Python is already now trending high as I imagined
      and I think it will only become more popular. Java is also very popular which I also expected since our entire education is more or less only been in java, and when looking at
      job applications java is a very requested language.
      <p>
      <p>
      It would depend on what we would be building. If it would be a website I would recommend javascript. However in general I would recommend java. I feel like java has a fairly 
      easy syntax, lots of documentation and is still being supported and updated regurlarly it will most likely only be working better over time. This is also a language that lots 
      of people know and if it's in a company where everyone already uses java it just makes it easy to get started.
      My TIL for this course is that there is so many different technologies for javascript. During the lecture we went over a graph of all the technologies and it fascinated me 
      how there is so many different ones for different uses. I have myself tried working with node.js in assignment 4 but there is so many others such as react, angular, ember etc. and 
      these are mostly for front end, wheras there is other technologies better suited for testing and back end.

  <p>.NET is a software framework build by microsoft and which is using c# for development together with other microsoft 
    languages such as visual basic. The framework has many inbuilt functionalities and pre build methods. when using .NET for
    development of an web application it is a very smart framework since it already has very clear and easy ways 
    to create things like routes and your cruds. routes is simply named after controller names and then by all of their classes.
    or CRUD opperations it is possible to use scaffolding and make the framework build not only your database but also alot of cruds reading and writing to it. 
    From my experience .NET is the technology that was most hard to get to know since compared to the others there was many things that
    you just need to know. As for my example to why it's good that is also my example to why it was hard to get to know. compared to nodejs or express as a rest api 
    .NET felt alot more strict in the way you had to set it up and that you had to program for it. This also mean that if you did that it all would run really
    smoothly.
    <p>
    <p>
    For the coding exercise I did a lot of research. I looked at multiple multiple tutorials and followed the tutorials for razorpages and for MVC on .net website.
    Their example were all using databases so since we had to use JSON I looked at your example and tried to work from that. I found it difficult to get the JSON to work 
    in the start and It took me some time to understanding how to use the [Route()] since during the tutorials the route would always be the controller name followed by the methods inside that
    controller. 
    <p>
    <p>
    My TIL for this course is how to work with the framework .NET and how important it is to take time to learn new frameworks. Ones I got to know it it felt like a framework
    I would like to try using for my own hobbys. I also really like developing usin gthe MVC architecture since it helps structured your whole project. since 
    you get to keep the logic, the data and the presentation of the data seperated.

  In General the 3 websites peformed well. They would load fast and all of them would have a time between 1-2 seconds for finishing loading the website with all content showing.
  Although when we analysed the websites using Light house ikea and sigma still did fine but suddenly Tetra pak looked grim. In accessibility and best practices they performed
  poorly compared to the other websites. For accessibility their The form labels did not have associated labels and buttons doesnt have accessible names. for best practices they
  still have 3 resources that they get through httpo 1.1 and not 2. They include front-end Javascript libriaries with known security vulnerabilities and browser errors are logged
  to the console.
<p>
<p>
  For this course section my TIL is that it is very easy to analyze websites performances using online tools. This way it's possible to see if they can be vulnerabilities as with 
  Tetra pak and just how fast the website is to load its site. It is also shows how many bytes of resources and you can easily look trough the requests to see which resources it is 
  that is being downloaded. Overall we learned some great tools and how to use more of the devtools inspect.

    There is a few of the OWASP top ten that I have been able to recognise in our proect at this very moment. one of them 
    being injections. Before we saw this, the way we created an account or logged in was by writing the credentials and then it would be 
    sent to the rest api who would then just insert it in a SQL statement without checking it. This would have allowed people with malicious intent 
    to easily login on other users profiles. Another issue was broken access control. Upon login we authenticate the user. though when 
    displaying what information that is saved to that account we did not do any form of authentication, which means that when the hacker just tries to enter random 
    id's or emails in the url, he would get access to someone elses information if he happened to write a right userid. A third thing that I believe to be really important
    is that we should start logging information. At the moment we are barely logging. and if that was on a launched website we would have a very slight chance 
    to notice if someone with malicious intent was doing something on our application.<p>
<p>
    For an guideline for essential security measures I would mention all the above. Make sure to sanetize your user inputs or 
    on the server side check if the input seems malicious. This is especially very important when those inputs is gonna be inserted into 
    SQL statements. use autherization tokens so that someone won't be able to get into others profiles by just changing the URL. It is also important to not send data like password or any vulnerable credentials in the URL since it will be easier for hackers to access it then. Other than that I would recommend 
    doing a threat modeling to get a better overview of where in your whole system the threats lie. This way you will be able to plan ahead and plan if you will need a proxy server 
    or if you should use an api to handle interaction between user and data(Which is something I would always recommend). It is never good to let the 
    client application have straight access to the database or where the data is stored.
    <p>

<p>
    My TIL for this course section was to learn how many ways an web application can be exploited. To me the injection and cross script vunlerabilities were very new. 
    It was also very interesting to me to see how easily a web application could be hacked simply by putting the wrong data in the URL, doing too little 
    authentications or by logging too vulnerable information. I found this course section to have been very interesting.
  </p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
